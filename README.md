# Groovy NullPointerException: Unexpected Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a common Groovy error related to null pointer exceptions caused by implicit null handling.  Groovy's flexible typing, while convenient, can lead to unexpected behavior if null values aren't explicitly checked for in your methods. The `bug.groovy` file contains code exhibiting the problematic behavior, while `bugSolution.groovy` provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description

The `myMethod` function in `bug.groovy` doesn't explicitly handle null input values. This can result in a `NullPointerException` when either `a` or `b` is null.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.groovy` file demonstrates how to properly handle potential null input parameters.  Explicit null checks are added to prevent exceptions and ensure predictable behavior. 

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.groovy` using a Groovy interpreter (e.g., `groovy bug.groovy`).
3. Observe the unexpected behavior or exception.
4. Run `bugSolution.groovy` to see the corrected implementation.

## Lessons Learned

- Always explicitly check for null values in Groovy methods, especially when dealing with external inputs or potentially nullable data.
- Use null-safe operators (.?. and .?.) when chaining method calls to safely handle nulls.
- Be aware of the implicit behavior of Groovy's loose typing and adjust your coding style accordingly.
